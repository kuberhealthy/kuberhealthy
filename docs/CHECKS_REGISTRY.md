# `HealthCheck` Registry

This list points to `HealthCheck` resources you can apply once Kuberhealthy is installed. If you have a check to share, open a PR and add it here. We love early contributions.
Most examples assume the `kuberhealthy` namespace; update the namespace fields if you installed elsewhere.
