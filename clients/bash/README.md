# Bash Client Example

This directory demonstrates a minimal Kuberhealthy check written in Bash.

The [`check.sh`](check.sh) script reads the Kuberhealthy run UUID and reporting URL from the `KH_RUN_UUID` and `KH_REPORTING_URL` environment variables that Kuberhealthy sets on checker pods. It then reports success or failure back to Kuberhealthy.

## Using the example

1. **Add your logic** – Replace the placeholder section in `check.sh` with commands that verify the condition you care about. Call `report_success` when the check passes or `report_failure "message"` when it fails.
2. **Build the image** – Build a container that runs the script:

   ```sh
   make build IMAGE=your-registry/bash-check TAG=v1
   ```

3. **Push the image** – Push the image to a registry accessible by your cluster:

   ```sh
   make push IMAGE=your-registry/bash-check TAG=v1
   ```

4. **Create a KuberhealthyCheck** – Reference the image in a `KuberhealthyCheck` resource and apply it to your cluster:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: comcast.github.io/v1
   kind: KuberhealthyCheck
   metadata:
     name: bash-example
     namespace: kuberhealthy
   spec:
     runInterval: 1m
     podSpec:
       containers:
       - name: bash
         image: your-registry/bash-check:v1
         imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
   ```

When the pod runs, `check.sh` will report its result to Kuberhealthy. Set the `FAIL=true` environment variable to simulate a failure.
