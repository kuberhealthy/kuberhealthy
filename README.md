**Kuberhealthy is a [CNCF Sandbox Project](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/)!**

**Kuberhealthy is a [Kubernetes operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) for [synthetic monitoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_monitoring) and [continuous process verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_verification_and_validation).**  You can [write your own test containers](docs/CHECK_CREATION.md) in any language and Kuberhealthy will run them and produce metrics for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io). Includes a simple JSON status page for custom integrations.

## What is Kuberhealthy?

Kuberhealthy lets you continuously verify that your applications and Kubernetes clusters are working as expected. By creating a custom resource (a [`KuberhealthyCheck`](https://github.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy/blob/master/docs/CHECKS.md#khcheck-anatomy)) in your cluster, you can easily enable [various synthetic tests](docs/CHECKS_REGISTRY.md) and get Prometheus metrics for them.

Kuberhealthy comes with [lots of useful checks already available](docs/CHECKS_REGISTRY.md) to ensure the core functionality of Kubernetes, but checks can be used to test anything you like.  We encourage you to [write your own check container](docs/CHECK_CREATION.md) in any language to test your own applications.  It really is quick and easy!

Kuberhealthy serves the status of all checks on a simple JSON status page and a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics endpoint (at `/metrics`). The OpenAPI specification for the API is available as JSON at `/openapi.yaml` and `/openapi.json` on the web server.


### DaemonSet Check in Action

## Quick Start

1. Install Kuberhealthy into your cluster:

   ```sh
   kubectl apply -k github.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy/deploy
   ```

2. Forward the Kuberhealthy service to your local machine:

   ```sh
   kubectl -n kuberhealthy port-forward svc/kuberhealthy 8080:80
   ```

3. Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the status page.

For advanced configuration options, see the [deployment guide](docs/deployingKuberhealthy.md) and the [full documentation](docs/).

### Hermit

While working on Kuberhealthy, you can take advantage of the included [Hermit](https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/) dev 
environment to get Go & other tooling without having to install them separately on your local machine.

Just use the following command to activate the environment, and you're good to go:

```zsh
. ./bin/activate-hermit
```
