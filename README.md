Kuberhealthy is a [Kubernetes operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) for [synthetic monitoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_monitoring) and [continuous process verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_verification_and_validation). You can [write your own test containers](docs/CHECK_CREATION.md) in any language or [deploy one of the included ones](docs/CHECKS_REGISTRY.md) and Kuberhealthy will run them and produce metrics for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io). Includes a simple JSON status page for custom integrations. Kuberhealthy is a **[CNCF Sandbox Project](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/)**.


### A Check in Action

Here is a step by step illustration of Kuberhealthy running the included deployment check that tests the creation and tear down of a Kubernetes deployment:

## TLDR Installation Instructions

1. Install Kuberhealthy into your cluster:

   ```sh
   kubectl apply -k github.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy/deploy/kustomize
   ```

2. Forward the Kuberhealthy service to your local machine:

   ```sh
   kubectl -n kuberhealthy port-forward svc/kuberhealthy 8080:8080
   ```

3. Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the status page.

4. Create a [HealthCheck](docs/CHECKS_REGISTRY.md) with `kubectl apply`.

For advanced configuration options, see the [deployment guide](docs/deployingKuberhealthy.md).
