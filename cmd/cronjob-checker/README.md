## CronJob Event Checker

The cronjob-checker fetches a list of all cronjobs in a namespace. After calculating the cron schedule, the check determines the last time the cronjob should have been scheduled through a simulation. It then verifies the last scheduled time was at the simulated time with a tolerance of plus or minus 30 seconds.

#### Example CronJob Event Checker

```yaml
