## Pod Restarts Check

The *Pod Restarts Check* checks for excessive pod restarts in a given `POD_NAMESPACE`. When the spec is applied to your
cluster, Kuberhealthy recognizes it as a KHCheck resource and provisions a checker pod to run the Pod Restarts Check.

The Pod Restarts Check deploys a pod that looks for pod resource events in a given `POD_NAMESPACE` and checks for
`Warning` event types with reason `BackOff`. If this specific event type count exceeds the `MAX_FAILURES_ALLOWED`, an
error is reporting back to Kuberhealthy.

In the example below, the check runs every 5m (spec.runInterval) with a check timeout set to 10 minutes (spec.timeout),
and a `MAX_FAILURES_ALLOWED` count set to 10. If the check does not complete within the given timeout it will report a
timeout error on the status page.
