## Pod Restarts Check

The *Pod Restarts Check* checks for excessive pod restarts in a given `POD_NAMESPACE`. When the spec is applied to your 
cluster, Kuberhealthy recognizes it as a KHCheck resource and provisions a checker pod to run the Pod Restarts Check. 
The Pod Restarts Check deploys a pod that loops through all the pods in the given `POD_NAMESPACE` and runs a ticker that 
keeps count of pod restarts within the given time frame `CHECK_RUN_WINDOW`. Pod restart counts that exceed the 
`MAX_FAILURES_ALLOWED` within the given time fram are reported back as check failures. 

In the example below, the check runs every hour (spec.runInterval), with a check timeout set to 58 minutes 
(spec.timeout), and a `CHECK_RUN_WINDOW` of 55 minutes. The check runs for 55 minutes, and every minute, the pod reports 
back either a failure or success depending on whether or not it found pods with restart counts that exceeded the 
`MAX_FAILURES_ALLOWED` count. If the check does not complete within the given timeout it will report a timeout error on 
the status page.

#### How-to 

To implement the Pod Restarts Check with Kuberhealthy, apply the configuration file [podRestartsCheck.yaml](podRestartsCheck.yaml) to your Kubernetes Cluster.
Make sure you are using the latest release of Kuberhealthy 2.0.0.
