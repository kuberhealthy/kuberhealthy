// ReportFailure reports that the external checker has found problems.  You may
// pass a slice of error message strings that will surface in the Kuberhealthy
// status page for more context on the failure.  We do not return an error here
// because the managing instance of Kuberhealthy for this check will detect the
// failure to report-in and raise an error upstream.
