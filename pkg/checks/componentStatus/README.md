#### componentStatus checker

No longer in use!  This check was removed from Kuberhealthy because componentstatus was easily monitored by other solutions and wasn't really a good example of a "synthetic test".  Furthermore, the other checks, like the DaemonsetChecker almost always found issues before this check.
